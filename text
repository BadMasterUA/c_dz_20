    Grey eyes – dawn,
    Steamship siren,
    Rain, parting, the gray wake
Behind the racing foam.
Black eyes – heat,
In the sea of sleepy stars' gliding,
And by the side until morning,
The reflection of kisses.
Blue eyes – moon,
The white silence of the waltz,
The daily wall
Of inevitable farewell.
Brown eyes – sand,
Autumn, steppe of wolves, hunting,
A leap, hanging by a hair
Between falling and flight.
No, I am not their judge,
Simply without vain judgments,
I am four times a debtor
To blue, gray, brown, and black.
Like the four sides
Of the same light,
I love – there is no fault in that –
All four of these colors.
